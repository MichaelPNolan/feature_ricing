This is a gemini-cli driven project, in fact I'm just doing this to learn Gemini. Or at least it seemed that way but of course I want a tool that is useful for just read all in one report all the apps and hopefully most succinct, relevant settings. Seeing colors - print to terminal is the main thing so expect colorized escape codes.

I plan to make the escape codes optional via a command.

Gemini is very naughty and often keeps trying to fix a bug unless i expressly say "that's not a bug" or don't fix that any more. Otherwise it never stops trying to refactor, fix, adjust to get requests you made that must exist as some kind of list of todos it makes. Expect to see Gemini-cli insights in this top level log.

You, the public, are welcome to use this tool and recommend improvements.
