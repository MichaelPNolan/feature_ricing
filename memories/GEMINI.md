## Gemini Added Memories
- The user wants the `config_link` symlink to ~/.config to remain in place for future sessions.
- The user previously suggested saving bug statuses into a file, and a `.gemini-settings.json` file was created for this purpose. I should be aware of this file for future bug-related tasks.
- The user has acknowledged my repeated `replace` failures and the looping behavior. I have explained that this is due to imprecise `old_string` matching and insufficient state tracking, not resource limitations. I have proposed several alternative approaches for code modification. I have recommended a "more granular `replace` with extreme caution on `old_string` construction" for the current task, with "using `read_file` and `write_file` for larger, contiguous blocks" as a fallback. I am awaiting the user's decision on which approach to use.
- Completed a major refactor of the colorization logic. Colorization patterns for Sway and Hyprland are now defined in `app_keyword_defs.conf`. A new generic module `colorize_app_keywords.py` handles reading these definitions and applying colorization. `colorize_sway.py` was renamed to `colorize_hyprland.py` and now acts as a wrapper. `reporter.py` was updated to use the generic colorizer for both applications, ensuring consistent and configurable colorization. Variables like `$mainMod = SUPER` are correctly categorized and colorized.
- It is dangerous to soft link to configuration files of the computer for testing purposes, as `ln -sf` can modify or overwrite the original file, leading to data loss. Always exercise extreme caution and verify file types before attempting to remove or modify files, especially when dealing with symlinks. Prefer creating temporary copies or using isolated environments for testing.
